    <p class="text-justify">The Eastern Michigan University Undergraduate Conference in Philosophy is now accepting papers for its conference to be held on Saturday and Sunday, November 8 th -9th, 2025. Papers selected for presentation will be allotted 20-minute presentation times, followed by formal comments and Q &amp; A. All papers in philosophy, broadly construed, will be considered for the conference; since this is an undergraduate conference, no papers by professionals, graduate students, or others holding an advanced degree (in philosophy) will be considered.</p>
    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>Papers submitted for the conference should be 8-12 pages (2200-3600 words) in length and include an abstract of approximately 250 words.</b></p>
    <p class="text-justify">The deadline for submission is <strong>Saturday, September 6th, 2025,</strong> and only completed papers accompanied by an abstract will be reviewed. We expect to announce the papers selected for presentation by the beginning of October.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">We will also be using a formal commenter system; so, even if your paper is not selected for presentation, you may be considered for such a role.  Please let us know, along with your paper submission, if you are willing to comment.  This also means that all selected papers will receive formal feedback at the conference.</p>
