    <p class="text-justify">The Eastern Michigan University Undergraduate Conference in Philosophy is now accepting papers
      for its conference to be held on Saturday and Sunday,<b> March 19th and 20th, 2022.</b>  Papers selected for presentation will be allotted 20 minute presentation times, followed by formal comments and Q & A.  All papers in philosophy, broadly construed, will be considered for the conference; since this is an undergraduate conference, no papers by professionals, graduate students, or others holding an advanced degree (in philosophy) will be considered.</p>
    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>Papers submitted for the conference should be 8-12 pages (2200-3600 words) in length and include an abstract approximately 250 words in length.</b></p>
    <p class="text-justify">The deadline for submission is <strong>Thursday, January 6th, 2022,</strong> and only completed papers accompanied by an abstract will be reviewed. We expect to announce the papers selected for presentation by the beginning of February.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">We will also be using a formal commenter system; so, even if your paper is not selected for presentation, you may be considered for such a role.  Please let us know, along with your paper submission, if you are willing to comment.  This also means that all selected papers will receive formal feedback at the conference.</p>

    <h4>Faculty Mentors</h4>
    <p class="text-justify">We have enjoyed having faculty attend in a purely support role.  We strongly encourage students to bring faculty mentors to the conference.  The dialog among professors, discussion of pedagogy, and expansion of mentoring opportunities for students, are among the desirable benefits of this conference. Additionally, faculty have played an important role in the success of the conference.</p>
